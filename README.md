# üêç Python Playwright News Article Scraper üìú

This little scraper scrapes the links to all articles from a given page and returns the title and substitle 
(but you can add pretty much any article information you need including the date, article text etc).

1. Fork the repo and clone it onto your machine.
2. Run the main.py first to collect the urls to individual articles from a category or results page on a news website. 
You have two code options - one to scrape everything in the category and another set to five pages (or you can adjust the number to your needs).
Uncomment whichever version you need.
4. Add any locators you like in the single_article.py or just run it to get all the titles and subtitles for the URLs that you got from the main.py.
If you search a different news site the locators will likely be slightly different, so make sure to inspect the elements and adjust the structure.

Enjoy!
